/// applied - unconditional whole-actor Glamourer revert, then simply dropping every tracked lock, since
/// nothing needs preserving when everything is being reverted anyway (design.md: "Panic keeps a single,
/// unconditional whole-actor revert") - but, per product decision, no longer ends any pairing. Panic is a
/// pure "clear my current state" safety valve: every relationship this device holds stays exactly as
/// paired as it was before. Ending a specific pairing is now a separate, deliberate action
/// (`ReleasePairing`, exposed from Settings) - see that method for the "AND remove restrictions" +
/// peer-notification behavior a deliberate unpair still needs. Each step is isolated in its own try/catch
/// so one failure (an IPC call throwing, a send failing) never stops the rest of the sequence from running.
